1. null == undefined will be true
2. null === undefined will be false

3. Truthy values and falsy values

It will take values in boolean context.

falsy values

0,-0,false,On(BigInt value),"",null,undefined,Nan, negative values all are falsy.

4. alert

just show the alert message

syntax:
alert("hello")

5.prompt

it shows a dialog box and takes input

syntax:
prompt("please enter your name)

6.Methods

Actions that can be performed on objects
Strings are immutable. New string only be created. changes wont affect in string.

7.negative slice calculation 

str.slice(-7,-1)

calculation will be done like string length - 7 for starting index.
string length - 1 for ending index


8. let no = [1,2,3,4,5]

typeof no will be object for this array.

Mixed arrays contains different types of values.

9. Arrays are mutable.

let arr = []

arr[0] = "basha"

arr[10] = "super duper hit"

console.log(arr)

arr[5] = "ahamath"

console.log(arr)

In this case of arr you specifically mention where to store so in between space will be empty.

10.Array references

Reference means address in memeory   

let arr1 = [1]
let arr2 = [1]

arr1 is memory address arr2 is another memory address so which will be false

[1] === [1] false
[1] == [1] false

11.constant array

const arr = [1,2,3,4]

by using const we can do operations. But we can not change the entire arr or giving new references

12.Nested Array

An array consist of multiple arrays.
