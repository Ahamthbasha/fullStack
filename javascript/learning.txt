1. null == undefined will be true
2. null === undefined will be false

3. Truthy values and falsy values

It will take values in boolean context.

falsy values

0,-0,false,On(BigInt value),"",null,undefined,Nan, negative values all are falsy.

4. alert

just show the alert message

syntax:
alert("hello")

5.prompt

it shows a dialog box and takes input

syntax:
prompt("please enter your name)

6.Methods

Actions that can be performed on objects
Strings are immutable. New string only be created. changes wont affect in string.

7.negative slice calculation 

str.slice(-7,-1)

calculation will be done like string length - 7 for starting index.
string length - 1 for ending index


8. let no = [1,2,3,4,5]

typeof no will be object for this array.

Mixed arrays contains different types of values.

9. Arrays are mutable.

let arr = []

arr[0] = "basha"

arr[10] = "super duper hit"

console.log(arr)

arr[5] = "ahamath"

console.log(arr)

In this case of arr you specifically mention where to store so in between space will be empty.

10.Array references

Reference means address in memeory   

let arr1 = [1]
let arr2 = [1]

arr1 is memory address arr2 is another memory address so which will be false

[1] === [1] false
[1] == [1] false

11.constant array

const arr = [1,2,3,4]

by using const we can do operations. But we can not change the entire arr or giving new references

12.Nested Array

An array consist of multiple arrays.


13.for loop used when we know the ending

14.Infinite loops

for(let i=1;i>=0;i++){

}

for(let i=1;i<=5;i--){

}

for(let i=1;i++){

}

15.nested for loop

16.while loop we use when we dont know the ending

17.For of loop is not work on internet explorer

18.object literals are objects which is used to store keyed collections and complex entities.

property => (key,value) pair

objects are a collection of properties.

js automatically converts object keys to string.
Even if we made the number as a key, the number will be converted to string.
Ex:

const obj = {
    1:"basha",
    null:"all rounder"
}

obj.1 will throw error you need to access like this obj[1]
obj.null will accessible

19.this refers to the current execution context

in object it denotes object
in function it denotes window 

20.try and catch

try statement allows you to define a block of code to be test for errors while it is being executed.

catch statement allows you to define a block of code to be executed, if an error occurs in the try block.

Ex:

try{
console.log(a)
}catch(error){
    console.log(`a is not defined`)
}

21. 
let chars = [..."hello"]
console.log(chars) //["h","e","l","l","o"]

let arr = [1,2,3,4]
let obj = {...arr}
console.log(obj) //{0:1,1:2,2:3,3:4}

let arr2 = "hello"
let obj = {...arr2}
console.log(obj) // {0:"h",1:"e",2:"l",3:"l",4:"o"}

22.destructure

let names = ["tony","bruce","peter","steve"]
let [winner,runner,...others] = names
console.log(others) // ["peter","steve"]
